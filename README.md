# Stoplight, a traffic study

Description: The lights of the four different stoplights change to green, yellow, or red based on the passage of time and through logical processing. The green light lasts for 9 seconds, the yellow light lasts for 3 seconds, and the red light lasts until it turns green. Whenever a car passes through the intersection, it prints a notification of the car. At the end of the program it prints observations about the cars that have passed.

_Make sure to put the "CarObservationsFile.txt" file in the Debug folder (".../Spotlight/bin/Debug")_
